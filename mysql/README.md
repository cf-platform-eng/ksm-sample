# MySQL

[MySQL](https://MySQL.org) is one of the most popular database servers in the world. Notable users include Wikipedia, Facebook and Google.

## Introduction

This chart bootstraps a single node MySQL deployment on a PCF (Pivotal Cloud Foundry).

## Prerequisites

- PCF environment with KSM installed and configured.
- ksm cli referred below is an alias configured to  `$KSM_PATH/ksm.darwin "$@" -k -t $KSM_SERVER -u $KSM_USER -p $KSM_PASSWORD`. 
If you want to create the same alias for your environment, add the following function to your .bash_profile, .profile or .bashrc files:

``` 
export KSM_PATH=<The path where your ksm.darwin is located>
export KSM_SERVER=http://<change_by_your_ksm_server>:<change_by_your_ksm_server_port>
export KSM_USER=<change_by_your_ksm_user>
export KSM_PASSWORD=<change_by_your_ksm_password>

ksm ()
{
    if [ -n "$ZSH_VERSION" ]; then
        emulate -L sh;
    fi;
    if [ "$1" == "" ]; then
        $KSM_PATH/ksm.darwin --help;
    else
        $KSM_PATH/ksm.darwin "$@" -k -t $KSM_SERVER -u $KSM_USER -p $KSM_PASSWORD;
    fi
}
```

- Kubernetes cluster registered with KSM and set as default
```bash
ksm cluster register my-cluster-name my-cluster-creds-file.yaml
ksm cluster set-default my-cluster-name
```

## Publishing the Marketplace Offer

To publish the marketplace offer:

<pre><b>$ ksm offer save mysql/ksm mysql/mysql-1.3.0.tgz</b></pre>

The command publishes MySQL offer on PCF. The marketplace name and version will match the name and version defined in `ksm.yaml` file.

Alternatively a &lt;ksm&gt;.yaml file can be defined in the ksm directory with a different marketplace name and used as input for `ksm offer save`:

__mysql/ksm/custom-mysql.yaml__ sample
```
marketplace-name: custom-mysql
charts:
  - chart: mysql
    offered: true
    scope: namespace
    version: 1.3.0
```

<pre><b>$ ksm offer save mysql/ksm mysql/mysql-1.3.0.tgz
</b></pre>

The current offers can be listed as following:

<pre>
<b>$ ksm offer list</b>
MARKETPLACE NAME	INCLUDED CHARTS	VERSION	PLANS
dokuwiki        	dokuwiki       	5.1.2  	[default]
mysql           	mysql          	1.3.0  	[medium small]
</pre>

## Enabling CF access 

The marketplace offer access is not available by default via cf command. You can verify that by calling the follow commands. 
Notice that mysql is not available at marketplace, even though it is listed by service-access (with access=none):

<pre>
<b>$ cf marketplace</b>
Getting services from marketplace in org ksm-dev / space dev as admin...
OK
service               plans                                                  description                                                                                                                                                                                                                           broker
dokuwiki              default                                                DokuWiki is a standards-compliant, simple to use wiki optimized for creating documentation. It is targeted at developer teams, workgroups, and small companies. All data is stored in plain text files, so no database is required.   kubernetes-service-manager

<b>$ cf service-access</b>
Getting service access as admin...
broker: kubernetes-service-manager
   service    plan      access   orgs
   dokuwiki   default   all
<b>   mysql      medium    none
   mysql      small     none</b>
</pre>

In order to enable the access, use the following command:

<pre>
<b>$ cf enable-service-access mysql</b>
Enabling access to all plans of service mysql for all orgs as admin...
OK

<b>$ cf marketplace</b>
Getting services from marketplace in org ksm-dev / space dev as admin...
OK

service               plans                                                  description                                                                                                                                                                                                                           broker
dokuwiki              default                                                DokuWiki is a standards-compliant, simple to use wiki optimized for creating documentation. It is targeted at developer teams, workgroups, and small companies. All data is stored in plain text files, so no database is required.   kubernetes-service-manager
<b>mysql                 small, medium                                          Fast, reliable, scalable, and easy to use open-source relational database system.                                                                                                                                                     kubernetes-service-manager</b>
</pre>
 
## Creating an instance

After enabling access to the markeplace offer, it's possible to provision a new instance.

First let's list the cf and kubernetes services:
<pre>
<b>$ cf services</b>
Getting services in org ksm-dev / space dev as admin...

No services found

Now, let's create a new instance. We can also list the new cf and kubernetes services

<pre>
<b>$ cf create-service mysql small mysql1</b> 

<b>$ cf services</b>
Getting services in org ksm-dev / space dev as admin...

name     service   plan    bound apps   last operation       broker
<b>mysql1   mysql     small                create in progress   kubernetes-service-manager</b>
</pre>

## Binding an app to mysql instance 

Please follow the instructions at https://github.com/cloudfoundry-samples/spring-music to build, deploy and bind the 
spring-music app to mysql database.
 
You should visualize the bindind details in spring-music app after binding process as following:

![After binding](./app-sample/after-binding.png)

## [Optional] See the data in MySQL instance

__Pre requisite:__ You must have mysql cli to execute this step!

You can verify the app data in MySQL instance as optional step. 
To do that:

- Create a service key for the MySQL instance:

<pre>
<b>$ cf create-service-key mysql1 mysql1-servicekey</b>
</pre>

- Verify the hostname, user and password in the service key data

<pre>
<b>$ cf service-key mysql1 mysql1-servicekey</b>
Getting key mysql1-servicekey for service instance mysql1 as admin...

{
 "hostname": "some_ip_address",
 "jdbcUrl": "jdbc:mysql://some_ip_address/my_db?user=root\u0026password=some_password\u0026useSSL=false",
 "name": "k-y6id2qob-mysql",
 "password": "some_password",
 "port": 3306,
 "uri": "mysql://root:some_password@some_ip_address:3306/my_db?reconnect=true",
 "username": "root"
}
</pre>

- Connect to the MySQL database:

<pre>
<b>$ mysql -u root -p -h some_ip_address</b>
Enter password:
