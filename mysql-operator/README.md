# MySQL Operator

[MySQL](https://MySQL.org) is one of the most popular database servers in the world. Notable users include Wikipedia, Facebook and Google.

## Introduction

This example includes a Helm chart for the Presslabs MySQL Operator, and a Helm chart for a MySQL Cluster instance.

## Prerequisites

- TAS environment with Tanzu Service Manager installed and configured.
- Connection setup for the `tsmgr` CLI to properly target an environment

``` 
export TSMGR_TARGET=http://<change_by_your_tsmgr_server>:<change_by_your_tsmgr_server_port>
export TSMGR_USER=<change_by_your_tsmgr_user>
export TSMGR_PASSWORD=<change_by_your_tsmgr_password>
export TSMGR_INSECURE=true # if using a lab environment
```

- Kubernetes [cluster registered with TSMGR](https://docs.pivotal.io/tanzu-service-manager/managing-clusters.html) and set as default
```bash
tsmgr cluster register my-cluster-name my-cluster-creds-file.yaml
tsmgr cluster set-default my-cluster-name
```

## Patterns for Offering Operators in Tanzu Service Manager

1) You can install (and upgrade) the operator manually into each cluster before offering the instance Helm chart in TSMGR.
    The operator must be configured to watch all namespaces in this approach. 
    ```bash
    helm install mysql-operator mysql-operator
    ```
    In this case, the offer `tsmgr.yaml` only needs to include the `mysql-cluster` instance Helm chart:
    ```
    offer-name: mysql-instance-only
    charts:
      - chart: mysql-cluster
        version: 0.2.0
        offered: true
        scope: namespace
    ```
    To offer the instance Helm chart:
    ```bash
    tsmgr offer save tsmgr/ mysql-cluster-0.2.0.tgz
    ```
   
1) (Recommended) You can offer both the `mysql-operator` and `mysql-cluster` Helm charts with TSMGR. 
This is recommended because the Platform Operator does not need to manually install the `mysql-operator` Helm chart
into each cluster where Developers may provision `mysql-cluster` instances. 
    
    You can offer the `mysql-operator` chart as either `Namespace` scoped or `Cluster` scoped. 
    
    `Namespace` scoped means the `mysql-operator` chart will be installed in every namespace along with the `mysql-cluster` instance.
    
    ```yaml
    offer-name: mysql-operator
    charts:
      - chart: mysql-operator
        version: 0.1.1+master
        offered: false
        scope: namespace
      - chart: mysql-cluster
        version: 0.2.0
        offered: true
        scope: namespace
    ```
   
     `Cluster` scoped means the `mysql-operator` chart will be installed once in the cluster and watch all namespaces.

    ```yaml
    offer-name: mysql-operator
    charts:
      - chart: mysql-operator
        version: 0.1.1+master
        offered: false
        scope: cluster
      - chart: mysql-cluster
        version: 0.2.0
        offered: true
        scope: namespace
    ```
   
    The instructions below follow the `Cluster` scoped pattern. 

## Saving the Offer

To save the offer:

```bash
$ tsmgr offer save tsmgr mysql-operator-0.1.1+master.tgz mysql-cluster-0.2.0.tgz
```

The command saves MySQL Operator offer on TAS. The offer name and version will match the name and version defined in `tsmgr.yaml` file.

The current offers can be listed as following:
<pre>
<b>$ tsmgr offer list</b>
OFFER NAME	INCLUDED CHARTS	VERSION	        PLANS
mysql-operator  	mysql-cluster  	0.2.0       	[default]
-               	mysql-operator 	0.1.1+master
</pre>

## Enabling CF access 

The offer access is not available by default in cf. You can verify that by calling the follow commands. 
Notice that mysql is not available in the marketplace, even though it is listed by service-access (with access=none):

```bash
$ cf marketplace
Getting services from marketplace in org tsmgr-dev / space dev as admin...
OK
service               plans                                                  description   

$ cf service-access
Getting service access as admin...
broker: tanzu-service-manager
   service          plan      access   orgs
   mysql-operator   default   none
```

In order to enable the access, use the following command:
```bash
$ cf enable-service-access mysql-operator
Enabling access to all plans of service mysql-operator for all orgs as admin...
OK

$ cf marketplace
Getting services from marketplace in org system / space dev as admin...
OK

service          plans     description                                                                         broker
mysql-operator   default   A Helm chart for easy deployment of a MySQL cluster with MySQL operator.            tanzu-service-manager
```
 
## Creating an instance

After enabling access to the offer in cf, it's possible to provision a new instance.

First let's list the cf and kubernetes services:
```bash
$ cf services
Getting services in org tsmgr-dev / space dev as admin...

No services found
```

Now, let's create a new instance. We can also list the new cf and kubernetes services
```bash
$ cf create-service mysql-operator default mysql-op1
Creating service instance mysql-op1 in org system / space dev as admin...
OK

Create in progress. Use 'cf services' or 'cf service mysql-op1' to check operation status.

$ cf services
Getting services in org system / space dev as admin...

name             service          plan      bound apps   last operation     broker                       upgrade available
mysql-op1        mysql-operator   default                create succeeded   tanzu-service-manager   no
```

## Binding an app to mysql instance 

Please follow the instructions at https://github.com/cloudfoundry-samples/spring-music to build, deploy and bind the 
spring-music app to mysql database.
 
You should visualize the binding details in spring-music app after binding process as following:

![After binding](../mysql/app-sample/after-binding.png)

## [Optional] See the data in MySQL instance

__Pre requisite:__ You must have mysql cli to execute this step!

You can verify the app data in MySQL instance as optional step. 
To do that:

- Create a service key for the MySQL instance:

<pre>
<b>$ cf create-service-key mysql-op1 mysql-servicekey</b>
</pre>

- Verify the hostname, user and password in the service key data

<pre>
<b>$ cf service-key mysql-op1 mysql-servicekey</b>
Getting key mysql-servicekey for service instance mysql-op as admin...

{
 "hostname": "10.10.11.11",
 "jdbcUrl": "jdbc:mysql://34.67.50.44/mydb?user=root\u0026password=root\u0026useSSL=false",
 "name": "k-ftwbah22-mysql-cluster-db",
 "password": "root",
 "port": 3306,
 "uri": "mysql://root:root@34.67.50.44:3306/mydb?reconnect=true",
 "username": "root"
}
</pre>

- Connect to the MySQL database:

```bash
$ mysql -u root -p -h <hostname></b>
Enter password:
