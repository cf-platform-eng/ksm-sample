# The bind.yaml is optional.
# Apps running in Tanzu Application Service gain access to bound service instances through an
#     environment variable named VCAP_SERVICES consisting of a credentials map.
# Create a binding template with desired bind format for the chart to be exposed. 
#
# The example below shows all available information, so you can use that to compose your own template.
#
# NOTE: Refer to the "(Optional) Create Binding Template for App Consumption" section in the "Preparing a Service Offering" document 
#     at https://docs.pivotal.io/tanzu-service-manager if you need further information.

    # ingresses: $.ingresses, # should be configured only if ingresses are available
    secrets: $.secrets, # will return all secrets in the namespace where service instance is installed
    services: $.services # will return all services in the namespace where service instance is installed
  }
